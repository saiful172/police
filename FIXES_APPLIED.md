# Police Verification System - Issues Fixed

## Issues Found and Resolved:

### 1. ✅ Table Name Mismatch (CRITICAL - This was blocking data insertion)
**Problem:** 
- Migration created table: `last_5years_stays`
- Laravel Model expected: `last5_years_stays` (snake_case of Last5YearsStay)

**Solution:**
Added explicit table name in `app/Models/Last5YearsStay.php`:
```php
protected $table = 'last_5years_stays';
```

### 2. ✅ Sessions Table Missing (Fixed earlier)
**Problem:** Database session driver required sessions table
**Solution:** Created migration for sessions table with proper schema

## Current System Status:

### ✅ Working Components:
1. **Form** (`resources/views/form/create-form.blade.php`)
   - Dynamic education rows with Add/Remove buttons
   - Dynamic stay rows with Add/Remove buttons
   - Proper validation error display
   - CSRF protection
   - Routes to `users.store` correctly

2. **Validation** (`app/Http/Requests/StoreUserRequest.php`)
   - All fields validated
   - Array validation for education and stays
   - Custom error messages
   - Authorization set to `true`

3. **Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`)
   - Transaction-based data insertion
   - Error logging
   - Proper redirects with success messages
   - All CRUD methods implemented

4. **Models**
   - User.php - Has relationships defined
   - EducationDetail.php - Belongs to User
   - Last5YearsStay.php - Belongs to User (NOW WITH CORRECT TABLE NAME)

5. **Database**
   - All tables exist:
     - users
     - education_details
     - last_5years_stays
     - sessions
   - Foreign keys properly set up
   - Cascade delete configured

## How to Test:

   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

2. **Access the form**:
   - Visit: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Or: `http://localhost:8000/users/create`

3. **Fill the form**:
   - Fill all personal information
   - Add at least 1 education detail
   - Add at least 1 stay detail
   - Click Submit

4. **Expected Result**:
   - Data should be inserted successfully
   - Redirect to show page with success message
   - All related data (education & stays) should be saved
